# **SystemVerilog 32x32-bit Multiplier Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a 32x32-bit multiplier in SystemVerilog, producing a 64-bit output. The design includes both behavioral and structural models, along with a word-serial multiplication (WSM) approach. The multiplier is designed for efficient simulation and analysis of digital circuits.

## **Features**
1. **Behavioral Model**:
   - Implements the design functionality using high-level concurrent algorithms.
   - Similar to C programming language in design abstraction.
   - Uses internal signals and arrays to perform efficient computations.

2. **Structural Model**:
   - Implements functionality using basic logic gates (AND, XOR, and majority functions).
   - Provides a gate-level logic diagram representation.

3. **Word-Serial Multiplier (WSM)**:
   - Combines the data path and control unit for word-serial multiplication.
   - Generates partial products and accumulates the result over multiple cycles.

4. **Control Unit**:
   - Synchronizes data inputs and manages multiplication steps using opcode signals.

5. **Data Path Unit**:
   - Comprises registers (A, D, Q), ALU, and counters for processing.

## **Simulation Details**
- A 64-bit output is generated by multiplying two 32-bit inputs.
- Both models (behavioral and structural) produce the same output but differ in complexity and latency.
- The behavioral model achieves faster simulation with lower design complexity.

## **Analysis and Conclusions**
- The WSM design relies on partial products, generating output over multiple cycles.
- The **behavioral model** has lower complexity and faster simulation time compared to the **structural model**, which offers greater control over circuit design.
